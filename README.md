#Oodebe

Oodebe is an asynchronous I/O based framework built on node.js for providing a consistent client (REST) API 
for synchronizing operations on one or more back-end server modules.


* Provides facilities to develop, test and deploy a REST API server
* Each API call can be constructed as a script
* Scripts can be executed as either native node.js scripts or one of the supported plugins
* Plugins allow scripts to access various REST servers such as Neo4j, SOLR, MongoDB, and Lily using their REST interface
* Additional plugins can be written in the form of simple JSON configuration files
