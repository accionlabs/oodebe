#Oodebe

Oodebe is an asynchronous I/O based framework built on node.js for providing a consistent client (REST) API 
for synchronizing operations on one or more back-end server modules.


* Provides facilities to develop, test and deploy a REST API server
* Each API call can be constructed as a script
* Scripts can be executed as either native node.js scripts or one of the supported plugins
* Plugins allow scripts to access various REST servers such as Neo4j, SOLR, MongoDB, and Lily using their REST interface
* Additional plugins can be written in the form of simple JSON configuration files

## Running Sample Scripts

After installation, if you start the oodebe web console, you will see various sample scripts for Lily, Neo4j, Node.js 
and Solr.  These scripts assume that you have all these servers correctly installed and configured in conf.js
